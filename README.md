# SkyHack_Hackathon

## Project Summary
This project centered around a thorough analysis of customer feedback data related to United Airlines' food and beverage (F&B) services. The objective was to gain insights into the factors affecting F&B satisfaction. 

## Project Objective
In this project, I achieved several Objectives:
1. Data Segmentation: I successfully segmented a dataset, allowing for more focused analysis.
2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: I conducted thorough data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure data quality and reliability.
3. Factors Impacting Satisfaction: I explored all factors influencing F&B satisfaction, prioritized those with major contributions, and categorized data by satisfaction types.
4. Visual Representation: I used bar charts to visually represent the relationship between customer satisfaction and various influencing factors, making complex data more accessible.
5. Planned Future Analyses: I outlined a comprehensive plan for future analyses, including machine learning algorithms for prediction, natural language processing for sentiment analysis, and inventory data examination for optimization insights.

## Implementation
In this project, I used:
1. Jupyter Notebooks: I mainly used this interactive environment scripting Python for data analysis, combining code, and explaning in a single document.
2. Python: It is a versatile and powerful language commonly used for data analysis and data manipulation due to its extensive libraries and ease of use.
3. Pandas: This is a Python library used for data manipulation and analysis. It's particularly useful for data cleaning, summarization, and transformation.
4. NumPy: This is another Python library used for numerical operations. It's essential for handling large arrays or matrices efficiently.
5. Microsoft Excel: This is a widely used spreadsheet software for data analysis and I mainly used it for visualizing the data I extracted in jupyter notebook.
